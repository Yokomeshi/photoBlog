title: Faroe Islands

Jutting out of the Atlantic ocean at haphazard slants, the rocky ridges that make up the Faroe Islands are formidable slates of basalt, formed 55 million years ago from lava flows erupting in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The land was believe to be settled by Irish / Scottish monks as early as 300 AD and taken over by Norwegian vikings around 900 AD, the islands have been under the rule of Norway and Denmark until 1948, when it achieved self-governing rights from the Kingdom of Denmark.

The name Faroe Islands, Føroyar in Faroese, is believed to mean either "Islands of Sheep" or "Islands of Land," depending on whether one uses the Old Norse definition of fær (sheep) and oyar (islands) or the Gaelic definition of fearrann (land).

The mere isolation and ruggedness of terrain has resulted in the Faroese people being exceptionally resourceful and self-sufficient. Natural resources are hardly wasted, and the domesticated livestock serve not only as a source of nourishment but also of tools and clothing. Many of the traditions have managed to stay relevant, including foods such as dried mutton and whale blubber.

The Faroese have historically lived in small communities spread out across the 18 islands, relying on each other and banding together to survive. Recently developed sub-sea tunnels, bridges, and ferry connections has led to a higher concentration of people living in towns with greater access to resources. The capital Tórshavn and surrounding areas boast a population of 21,000 - roughly 40% of the total population.
