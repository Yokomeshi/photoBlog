title: Faroe Islands

Jutting out of the Atlantic ocean at haphazard slants reaching towards the sky, the rocky ridges that make up the Faroe Islands are formidable slates of basalt formed 55 million years ago from lava flows erupting in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

The land is believed to be settled by Irish / Scottish monks as early as 300 AD and taken over by Norwegian vikings around 900 AD. The islands have changed hands under the rule of Norway or Denmark until 1948 when a referendum set forth self-governing rights and for the Faroese to have representation within the Kingdom of Denmark.

The name Faroe Islands, Føroyar in Faroese, could be translated into either "Islands of Sheep" or "Islands of Land," depending on whether one uses the Old Norse word for sheep (fær) or the Gaelic word for land (fearrann), combined with the Old Faroese word for islands (oyar).

The mere isolation and ruggedness of the terrain has resulted in the Faroese people being exceptionally resourceful and self-sufficient. Natural resources are hardly wasted, and the domesticated livestock serve not only as a source of nourishment but also a source of tools and clothing. Many of the traditions have managed to stay - due to the limited contact with the rest of the European continent - including eating foods such as dried mutton and whale. The music and dance is strongly rooted in old Nordic culture, with pagan elements that were often sought to be banished by the church in other Nordic countries. The traditional music is primarily vocal, with the Faroese accompanying the vocal ballads with a dance done in a circle, a dance consisting of bodies wavering to the cascading build-ups of the rhythmic chants.

The Faroese have historically lived in small communities spread out across the 18 islands, relying on each other and banding together to survive. Recently developed sub-sea tunnels, bridges, and ferries have led to a higher concentration of people living in towns with greater access to resources. The capital Tórshavn and its surrounding areas boast a population of 21,000 - roughly 40% of the total population.

The islands are an important pit-stop for many migratory species, with over 250 birds, whales, and other sea life stopping by before carrying on to their next destination. One of the birds, the Oystercatcher, is the national bird of the Faroe Islands. With its needle-like orange, red bill standing out against its black and white feathers, the Oystercatcher is the subject of many poems and myths. One of the poems, written by a Faroese National hero Nólsoyar Páll, salutes the Oystercatcher as being the defender of lesser creatures against birds of prey, an allegory to the Faroese's challenge in overcoming Danish rule. And when the Oystercatcher is first spotted in a new year, the Faroese graciously welcome the sighting as it marks the start of summer.
