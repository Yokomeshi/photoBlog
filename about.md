Dear Reader,

Thanks for stopping by, and a warm welcome to this archive.

We've shared this collection of journeys to inspire the adventurers, the explorers, the curious, and the fearless to step outside and find their path. To seek the unbeaten strength of the world, to revel in its magnificent beauty, and to be reminded how small we Humans really are.

Before sharing the reasoning behind choosing the name Yūgen Today, a brief history of the term *yūgen* is in store. The Kanji for *yūgen* originates from Chinese text, most likely introduced to Japan by way of Buddhist monks in the 5th century. The original meaning of *yūgen* was multi-layered, and has since changed with time. Its usage has been highly contextual, and the word has not been easily translated into English, although courageous renditions have been made.

To understand *yūgen*, one must embark on a journey. A journey filled with shadows, dead ends, hidden passages and shortcuts. A journey that tests your imagination and proves your grit beyond what's thought possible. David Kaula, author of "On Noh Drama" described *yūgen* to be *"the sense of the mysterious quiescence beneath all things."* Zeami Motokiyo painted another picture - *“To watch the sun sink behind a flower clad hill. To wander on in a huge forest without thought of return. To stand upon the shore and gaze after a boat that disappears behind distant islands. To contemplate the flight of wild geese seen and lost among the clouds…”*

The blog is named Yūgen Today, because our stories and photos are an attempt at evoking a feeling which is indescribable. Perhaps you've come across this in your travels. Through our readership, we can help build a seed of shared understanding and from that seed blooms a flower, a tree, a forest, even a world, limited only by how far imaginations can run.
