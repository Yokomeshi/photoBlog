Thanks for stopping by, and a warm welcome to this journal.

The ensuing essays archived in Yūgen Today stand to document glimpses into cultures around our world, inviting us to build an understanding of that which exists outside our own.

Before sharing the reasoning behind  the name Yūgen Today, a brief history of *yūgen* is in order. The written Kanji for *yūgen* originated from Chinese text, most likely introduced to Japan by Buddhist monks during the 5th century. To understand the meaning of *yūgen*, the reader inevitably embarks on a journey. A journey filled with shadows, dead ends, hidden passages, and shortcuts. A journey that tests your imagination and proves your grit beyond what's thought possible. David Kaula, author of "On Noh Drama" described *yūgen* to be *"the sense of the mysterious quiescence beneath all things."* Zeami Motokiyo painted another picture - *“To watch the sun sink behind a flower clad hill. To wander on in a huge forest without thought of return. To stand upon the shore and gaze after a boat that disappears behind distant islands. To contemplate the flight of wild geese seen and lost among the clouds…”*

This journal was named Yūgen Today, because our essays and photos are an attempt to evoke a dichotomous feeling of emptiness and fulfillment, a state of feeling at one with your surroundings while awake to the fact that we occupy an infinitesimally small slice of time - perhaps you've come across this feeling in your travels. Through our readership, we hope to build a seed of shared understanding, and from that seed blooms a flower, a tree, a forest, and even a world.
